/*
Task
===========

1. Create two integer variables a and b and initialize them with values 3 and 2
respectively. Divide a by b and print the result.

2. Create two float variables c and d and initialize them with values 3 and 2
respectively. Divide c by d and print the result.

Why are the results different?

3. Explain why the following example prints 1.0 instead of 1.5. Can you fix
the problem?

  float e = 3 / 2;
  printf("%.1f\n", e);
